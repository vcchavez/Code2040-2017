API Challenge for the Code 2040 2017 Fellows Application

Overall, I learned a lot while working on this challenge. Python isn't my strong suit but 
	most of my experience connecting to APIs (solely for hackathons) has been with Python
	as I've found it to be very efficient and clean (not to mention its incredible repertoire
	of libraries and packages). I learned some pretty neat tricks about Python (such as
	how to reverse a string by slicing!) and became more familiar with HTTP requests.
